## Hey there 👋 my name is Murat

I'm from London 🇬🇧, living in the GMT time zone 🌍. I'm a big fan of coding in Next.js ⚡ and, more recently, implementing Payload CMS 🛠️. I love testing new software — with tech evolving so fast, it feels like there’s something new to explore every second ⏱️.

When I'm not programming, you’ll probably find me eating 🍽️, training calisthenics 🤸, playing padel 🎾, or gaming 🎮.



## 🛠️ I'm currently working on 

Whilst freelancing, I’m developing ShipShip ⛴️ — an open-source dynamic project creator built with Next.js and Payload CMS. Leveraging Next.js’s clean structure and Payload CMS’s simplicity, the goal is to create a boilerplate where, with just a few selections (e.g., authentication, database, emailing, blogs, etc.), you can instantly generate a project template that’s already close to production-ready.

No more starting from scratch — just pick what you need and set sail 🚀.
